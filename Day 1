Introduction to Linux
Linux is an operating system (OS) that works like the brain of a computer. It helps your computer hardware and software talk to each other. Unlike other OS like Windows or macOS, Linux is free and open-source, meaning anyone can use and modify it. It was created by Linus Torvalds in 1991.

What is Linux and Where Did it Come From?
Linux was developed as an alternative to UNIX, a commercial operating system used in big companies. Linus Torvalds wanted to create something free and accessible for everyone.



Key Features:
Open-source: Free to use and customize.

Inspired by UNIX: Works similarly but is available for everyone.

Community-driven: People from all over the world contribute to improving it.

Example:
Popular Linux versions like Ubuntu and Mint are easy to use, even for beginners. They’re great for everyday tasks like browsing, writing documents, or watching videos.

Why is Linux Important Today?
Linux is used everywhere because it’s flexible, reliable, and secure. In fact, 91% of online applications run on Linux! Here are a few reasons why:

Where Linux is Used:
Web Servers: Most websites you visit run on Linux.

Cloud Platforms: Services like Google Cloud and Amazon AWS use Linux.

Everyday Devices: Android phones are based on Linux.

Security: Tools like Kali Linux help experts protect computers from hackers.

Example:
If you’ve used Google or Facebook, you’ve interacted with Linux-powered servers!

Flavours Of Linux :
Flavours of linux, means type of Linux
Ubuntu ( commonly use )

Cent os, RHEL ( red hat )

Mint os

Fidora

Kali ( for hackers )

AL2 ( amazo base linux)

How Does Linux Work? (For Beginners)
Think of Linux like a translator between you and your computer. When you click or type something, Linux takes that request, processes it, and makes your computer do the work.

Linux Architecture


In simple way that

User talk to Application → Application talk to Shell → Shell talk to Kernel → kernel talk to Hardware

It means using terminal ( Application ) we can interact with shell and shell read requests of user and send to karnel and karnel take action according to user request.

Shell :

The shell is a program that interprets your commands and communicates them to the kernel. There are several types of shells, each with unique features:

Type Of Shell
.sh

.Bash

.Zsh

.Fish

.Csh

.Fsh

Example:
When you type ls in the terminal, the shell talks to the kernel, which then lists the files in a folder.

Linux Basics Everyone Should Know
What is a Terminal?
The terminal is an app that lets you type instructions to the computer. It’s like talking to your computer directly!

Example:
Type pwd to see which folder you’re in or mkdir new_folder to create a new folder.

Important Fact:
In Linux, everything is either a file (like a photo or document) or a directory (folder).

Popular Versions (Distributions) of Linux
There are many types of Linux to suit different needs:

Ubuntu: Great for beginners.

Mint: Easy and lightweight for older computers.

Fedora: For developers who want the latest software.

Kali Linux: A favorite for cybersecurity experts.

Conclusion
Linux is everywhere! It’s free, secure, and easy to learn if you take it step by step. Whether you’re browsing the web, using an Android phone, or learning something new, Linux is likely behind it. Give it a try today!
